The `Bootstrap Roughness Modeler` Tool is located under the `Analysis`  menu and under the `Roughness Analysis` sub-menu:

When the `Bootstrap Roughness Modeler` is run, the following dialog appears:

#### INPUTS:

The inputs for this tool are:

- **Input Survey Points**
  - Point feature class of the points used to create the digital elevation model (DEM) used as input below.
- **Survey Extent**
  - Polygon feature class representing the extent of the survey.
- **Channel Extent (optional)**
  - Polygon feature class representing areas not to be included in the bootstrapping. For example if a channel unit polygon feature class is used as input then the bootstrap will only be performed using points that exist outside of the channel unit feature class.
- **DEM**
  - Digital elevation model (DEM) that was created from the input survey points.
- **Convert to millimeters **(optional)
  - if this check box is selected then the output results will be in millimeters (useful for flume data)
- **Vertical units of DEM **(optional, only enabled if Convert to millimeters is checked)
  - grain size metrics are generally reported in millimeters so a conversion based on this value is performed to get values in millimeters.
- **Number of Iterations**
  - controls the number of times that points should be randomly sampled and differenced from the DEM.
- **Percent of data to keep as subset each iteration**
  - controls the percent of data that should be kept during each iteration to make a DEM to compare with the DEM provided above.

#### OUTPUTS:

The outputs for the tool are:

- **Output Raster Path**
  - path to save the output bootstrap roughness raster to. The output raster is comprised of the mean delta Z between each iteration of sub-setting points and the original DEM.
